#whats in APK when you open
I had created a basic Android APP which takes user mobile number for input, and then ask for the name and Referral Code which is provided by other user if any else user can signup without code.

few screenshots of APK in my phone are attached

1)This is first interface on app opening and you insert your mobile number and gets the OTP

2) Here it will auto detect the OTP
